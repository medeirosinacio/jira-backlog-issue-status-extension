# Jira Board Backlog Status Enhancer | Extension

This is a browser extension that adds missing issue status information to the backlog page of Jira. It is available for
download on the Chrome Store.

The extension was motivated by the issue of missing issue status information on the backlog page of Jira projects
managed by companies. This made it difficult to view the status of each issue on the task board, resulting in an
unorganized display of information. With this extension, the status of each issue is now displayed on the task board,
resulting in a more organized and easily readable display of information.
